# NoteVision
Turning handwritten sheet music into ABC Notation (a text-based format for writing music).

By @jona-nakai, @jessicayzhao, @Groxietop, and @gavwin

Forked from https://github.com/jonanakai/SheetMusic-to-Text. The old SheetMusic-to-Text repository was for a class project (Northeastern's DS4440: Practical Neural Networks). NoteVision is a continuation of this class project in an attempt to create a working product.
