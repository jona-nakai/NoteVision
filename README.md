# NoteVision
Turning handwritten sheet music into text (ABC Notation).

By Jona Nakai, Jessica Zhao, Aaron Gordan, and Gavin Wainwright

Forked from https://github.com/jonanakai/SheetMusic-to-Text. The old SheetMusic-to-Text repository was for a class project (Northeastern's DS4440: Practical Neural Networks). NoteVision is a continuation of this class project in an attempt to create a working product.
